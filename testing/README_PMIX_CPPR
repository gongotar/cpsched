How to run/use the PMIx and CPPR test scripts (Basic Acceptance Tests):
scr_base.sh is a shell script that contains exports and paths to the build being tested
scr_bat_wrapper.py is the python script that is used to kick off the tests and setup/teardown
launch_dvm.sh is a script that launches the orte-dvm for submitting jobs
launch_cppr.sh is a script that launches the cppr daemon
stop_cppr.sh is a script that shuts down the cppr daemon
submit_command.sh is used to submit the jobscript to the orte-dvm
jobscript_simple.sh is the jobscript to actually run the tests
PMIX_TEST is the script that contains all the tests

The basic flow of running the tests is:
usage is: python scr_bat_wrapper.py <path to build> <csv hostlist>

this will do the following:
1. start the orte-dvm and cppr daemon with the corresponding scripts
2. submit the jobscript with submit_command.sh
3. block until the tests complete
4. scan the output file to see if the tests completed successfully
5. shutdown the cppr daemon and the orte-dvm
6. report test status and exit

a report of all the logs from the test run will be contained in test_output.txt

Configurations: 
these tests can either be run on the PMIx only build of SCR or on a build which is configured with PMIx and CPPR
